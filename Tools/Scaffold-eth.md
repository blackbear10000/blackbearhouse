## Introduction

Scaffold-eth provides an off-the-shelf stack for rapid prototyping on Ethereum, giving developers access to state-of-the-art tools to quickly learn and ship an Ethereum-based dApp.

Scaffold-eth is not a product itself but more of a combination or stack of other great tools. It allows you to quickly build and iterate over your smart contracts and frontends.

Here are the main components:

- Solidity for writing smart contracts.
- Hardhat for running local networks, deploying and testing smart contracts.
- React for building a frontend, using many useful pre-made components and hooks.
- Ethers.js for interacting with deployed smart contracts and the frontend
- Ant for your UI. Can be easily changed to Bootstrap or some other library you prefer.
